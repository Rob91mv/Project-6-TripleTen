## Project Overview:
In this assignment, data for taxi companies and neighbourhoods in Chicago will be analysed and visualised. The project will also test whether average trip lengths from the Loop to O'Hare Airport differ on rainy Saturdays, enabling data-driven conclusions.

**Trips_base**

| Variable               | Description                                                           |

| dropoff_location_name  | Chicago neighbourhoods where trips ended                              |
| average_trips          | Average number of trips that ended in each neighbourhood in November 2017 |

**Weather_base**

| Variable           | Description                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| start_ts           | Pickup date and time                                      |
| weather_conditions | Weather conditions at the start of the trip               |
| duration_seconds   | Trip duration in seconds                                  |

## Impact:
This project analyzed Chicago taxi data to assess trip patterns and test if average trip lengths from the Loop to O'Hare Airport differ on rainy Saturdays. Key results showed that the neighborhoods Loop, River North, and Streeterville had the highest trip volumes, while Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services, and Medallion Leasing led among taxi companies. Importantly, hypothesis testing confirmed no significant difference in average trip durations between rainy and non-rainy Saturdays. These findings offer actionable insights for taxi operations regardless of weather conditions.
